# MindMaps from Futurist directives produced by ChatGPT

![iAQ_UML](https://github.com/ashenfernando1/mindMaps/assets/51672857/c0c2a9e0-44d3-4148-bdf0-ad2c652703f7)

- The purpose of this repo/colab is to format ChatGPT plain text of 'Futurist' directives and create PlantUML drawings 
- To get the necessary input, enter the following prompt to ChatGPT, with a desired topic:

> Acting as a futurist, start by creating a simple MindMap on the consequences of **your topic**. (e.g.: exposure to particulate matter)

> Can you give a mindmap in PlantUML format. Keep it structured from the core central topic branching out to first order consequences. Don't label as first order consequences, second order consequences etc. Treat the second order consequences as branches from the first order ones, third order as branches from the second and so on. Let's go to 4 levels to begin with. Add the start and end minimap tags.

Use the colab below to generate the formatted output and use https://www.planttext.com/ to generate MindMaps.

Things to do:
- [ ] Add more color dictionaries
  - [ ] Display them on the notebook for ease
- [ ] If desired, separate the blocks to left and right side, depending on their length
